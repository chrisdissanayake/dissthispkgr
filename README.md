Chris Dissanayake's Personal R Package
--------------------------
"diss-this-package-R!" 
My name might start with "Diss," but don't try to diss me. I can come up with a comeback faster than you can say "Dissanayake."

This is the personal R package of [Chris Dissanayake](https://chrisdissanayake.netlify.app/).

Contains custom functions that perform specific tasks like data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, which are documented for my convenience.

In the future, my intention is to develop this into a meta-package to simplify the management as the collection grows.
